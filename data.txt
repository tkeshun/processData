Package os provides a platform-independent interface to operating system functionality. 
The design is Unix-like, although the error handling is Go-like; failing calls return values of type error rather than error numbers.
Often, more information is available within the error. 
For example, if a call that takes a file name fails, such as Open or Stat, the error will include the failing file name when printed and will be of type *PathError, which may be unpacked for more information.
The os interface is intended to be uniform across all operating systems.
Features not generally available appear in the system-specific package syscall.
Here is a simple example, opening a file and reading some of it.
